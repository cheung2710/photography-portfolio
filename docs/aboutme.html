        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div></div>
        <p>	&emsp;I started shooting photos in 2020 when I took Photography in high school, and it's been a hobby ever since. 
            I enjoy capturing little moments and places that most people would ignore or not even notice.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;To me, photography is a creative outlet and a way to light up all the underappreciated parts of life.
            Now, throughout each day, I look for interesting patterns of light, the most important part of a photo. 
            I try to use beautiful light to turn the mundaneâ€”pens, spoons, telephone polesâ€”into something worth remembering.</p>
